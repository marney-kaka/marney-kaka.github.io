    <h1>My Updated Learning Plan</h1> 
     
        <p>
          Going into Bootcamp, my learning plan changes only slightly. I have always planned to take the skills I gain during this course back to my whānau/hapū and iwi. I am hoping to use these skills to first start out creating a family directory that tracks health risks throughout generations, a skills directory and a repository for mātauranga Māori (medicine, karakia, rituals etc.). It has been a dormant project for years and Im hoping to start doing this project as soon as I know how.

          Originally, I thought my curiosity would be a strength, however, I found that my curiosity got the better of me in Foundations and I sent myself down a lot of rabbit holes searching and learning other things instead of staying on track.
          After foundations I think my biggest strengths will be working with people. I think working alongside others to solve problems worked really well for me and I had alot of fun as well. Just the thought of group work in Bootcamp used to stir up my anxiety, but now I am looking forward to it. I do, however, struggle with giving quality feedback on the spot. I have to let it simmer or take a lot of notes throughout (formative assessment). When asked questions, my anxiety shoots through the roof. Also keeping up with everyone and the learning. I was always on the backfoot in Foundations trying to understand everything fully and I know that Bootcamp is a bit more fast paced. 
        </p>

          I would still like to work on improving my reliability and asking for help while at Dev Academy. I also hope to develop some better time management and study habits and giving feedback as well. I’ve already picked up some really handy time management and study habit tips after Foundations and I’m excited to see how these develop by the end of Bootcamp.
          My expectations for Bootcamp facilitators are still the same and in addition to my guiding principles I expect to be respectful, kind, empathetic and mindful of other’s feelings and levels of understanding.
          During foundations I didn’t post into Discord when I got stuck and stayed with my homegroup peers. While this was a preference, it is not going to help me in the working world. This is something I expect to change in Bootcamp.

    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1> 
     
        <p>I would like to eventually see myself in a data scientist role or being part of a team creating game changing technology, especially for my whānau, hapū and iwi. That would be the best goal in my opinion.</p>

        <p>My strengths are my curiosity and attention to detail. I like
            to investigate what happened, learning constantly and seeing the big picture.
            I like learning about new things and questioning them in order to be prepared. 
            These are also traits of an introvert which I completely expected. I am an introvert 
            through and through and I am still working on letting go of my ego. I think this is where my biggest weaknesses and limitations stem from.
        <p>My limitations are made known when I get stuck on the details (especially when it isnt making sense to me). 
            I find it hard to move on to the next step without figuring it out. I will always find myself going back to it to try and complete it and use up precious time and energy.</p>     
            
        <p>The whole human skills component of this Dev Academy course is very difficult
            for me, although, I enjoy the challenge. I can see how this will only make me
            better not just as a learner but as a Team player. Being reliable is one human
            skill that I would really like to develop. If I can improve that then I think
            I can walk away from this course happy. The other human skill I would really
            like to develop is asking for help. I am one that likes to keep trying to
            find an answer to a problem by myself, no matter how long it takes. I need to 
            first; know when to ask for help, and second; let go of my ego and have the 
            courage to ask.</p>
      
        <div class="grey-box">
        <p>I will work productively and safely with others using the following guiding principles:
          <ul>
            <strong><li>Manaakitanga</strong><br>
            Reciprocating acts of kindness</li>
            <br>
            
            <li><strong>Rangatiratanga</strong><br>
            Showing mutual respect for each other's mana (boundaries, skillset, time, presence etc.)</li>
            <br>
            
            <li><strong>Kotahitanga</strong><br>
            Working together to achieve tasks. Sharing struggles and helping where you can.</li>
            <br>
            
            <li><strong>Whanaungatanga</strong><br>
            Develop and maintain strong relationships/rapport.</li>
            <br>

            </ul>
          </p>
          <br>
          When things are building up and starting to get to me, I will retreat away from home to the library where I can unplug and get away from distractions.</strong>
        </div>
        <p>My homegroup peers have been a great help when I have gotten myself stuck.
             I haven't used any of the channels yet in discord to ask for help. 
             I will make sure to use them moving forward.</p>
      
        <p>Having clear communications expressed with kindness and understanding is pretty much all I can ask of the facilitators. I think they are doing a great job of this already.</p>
        <p>As for myself, my family have 3 reunions coming up next year and there are things such as planning, fundraising and administrative tasks that I am asked to do at random. Other than these and my parents, I don’t have any other family commitments that need  to be planned in to my study schedule.</p>

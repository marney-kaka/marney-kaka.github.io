    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1> 
     
        <p>I would like to eventually see myself in a data scientist role or being part of a team creating game changing technology, especially for my whānau, hapū and iwi. That would be the best goal in my opinion.</p>

        <p>My strengths are my curiosity and attention to detail. I like
            to investigate what happened, learning constantly and seeing the big picture.
            I like learning about new things and questioning them in order to be prepared. 
            These are also traits of an introvert which I completely expected. I am an introvert 
            through and through and I am still working on letting go of my ego. I think this is where my biggest weaknesses and limitations stem from.
        <p>My limitations are made known when I get stuck on the details (especially when it isnt making sense to me). 
            I find it hard to move on to the next step without figuring it out. I will always find myself going back to it to try and complete it and use up precious time and energy.</p>     
            
        <p>The whole human skills component of this Dev Academy course is very difficult
            for me, although, I enjoy the challenge. I can see how this will only make me
            better not just as a learner but as a Team player. Being reliable is one human
            skill that I would really like to develop. If I can improve that then I think
            I can walk away from this course happy. The other human skill I would really
            like to develop is asking for help. I am one that likes to keep trying to
            find an answer to a problem by myself, no matter how long it takes. I need to 
            first; know when to ask for help, and second; let go of my ego and have the 
            courage to ask.</p>
      
        <div class="li">
        <p>I will work productively and safely with others using the following guiding principles:
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li><strong>Manaakitanga</strong></li>
            Reciprocating acts of kindness<br>
            
            <li><strong>Rangatiratanga</strong></li>
            Showing mutual respect for each other's mana (boundaries, skillset, time, presence etc.)<br>
            
            <li><strong>Kotahitanga</strong></li>
            Working together to achieve tasks. Sharing struggles and helping where you can.<br>
            
            <li><strong>Whanaungatanga</strong></li>
            Develop and maintain strong relationships/rapport.<br>
            </ul></p><br>
          When things are building up and starting to get to me, I will  run away from home to the library where I can unplug and get away from distractions. It did the trick for me recently, and lucky for me my work can be done offline.</strong>
        </div>
        <p>My homegroup peers have been a great help when I have gotten myself stuck.
             I haven't used any of the channels yet in discord to ask for help. 
             I will make sure to use them moving forward.</p>
      
        <p>Having clear communications expressed with kindness and understanding is pretty much all I can ask of the facilitators. I think they are doing a great job of this already.</p>
        <p>As for myself, my family have 3 reunions coming up next year and there are things such as planning, fundraising and administrative tasks that I am asked to do at random. Other than these and my parents, I don’t have any other family commitments that need  to be planned in to my study schedule.</p>

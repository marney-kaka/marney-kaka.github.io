     <h1>My identity, values and strengths</h1>
      <p>I havent had to deal with an ethical dillema suppose a simple ethical choice for me would be going "green". Being aware of the impact I am having on the environment as a consumer has opened my eyes 
        and I actively help to reduce plastic waste being consumed (by me and my household).</p>

      <p>I am proud and ever grateful for being raised by not only my parents, but my wider whānau a.k.a "the village".
       I grew up in what felt like a bubble, looking at the world through a Māori lens which taught me to respect and appreciate our tikanga (doing things
       right), the environment. and whakapapa (how everthing in the environment
       is connected, not just people). The reciprocal relationship between people and the environment is a big
       deal as kaitiaki (caregivers) so respect for one another and the whakapapa between us is at the core of it all.</p>
      
      <p>My culture, connections, cretivity, curiosity and chill attitude towards life are my 
      underlying strengths. I like to learn new things to be able to build and implement concepts.
      Asking questions, using my family to bounce off and keeping calm in stressful situations have already helped me to keep my spirits up.     
      While I understand better by seeing the big picture, I can easily get caught
      up in the little details to get a greater grasp of how things work. This is where
      I can risk losing alot of time.</p>
      
      
      <p>In my last place of employment, it was very difficult to encourage change. 
      Trying to shift complacent people seemed impossible and there was a lot of 
      tension when introducing new ways. We tried involving them in to the decision 
      making process to give them a sense of control and ownership. This worked well 
      in the beginning,  however, there were some changes that were non-negotiable 
      which upset them and defeatist attitudes starting showing in the group. 
      Looking back, I would still follow the same strategy, however, I would clearly 
      outline negotiables and non-negotiables between sponsors and subject matter 
      experts before bringing people in.</p>

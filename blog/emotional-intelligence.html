        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1><br>
        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          <p>Being attentive to ones emotions without judgement. 
            Verywellmind.com defines emotional intelligence as 'the ability to 
            understand, interpret, and respond to the emotions of others'. 
            However, this is only looking outwards. It can also be a self-awareness 
            tool to better conduct ourselves in society by applying the same skills above
            to yourself.</p><br><br>
        
        <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
          <p>EQ stands for Emotional Quotient and IQ stands for Intelligence quotient.
            EQ is about one's attention, understanding and response to the <strong>emotions</strong> in others and themselves. It is also referred to as 'Street Smarts'. 
            IQ is focused is about one's logical ability and their academic competency - their intellect.
            A score of 140 and above is considered to be a genius level.
          </p><br><br>

        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
          <p>One with good EQ can better recognise their state, control their reaction and relate to others and yourself. Emotional Intelligence is seen in people with leadership roles and is a skill learned over time.</p>

          <p>Look at Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory who has an IQ of 187, but the emotional intelligence of a new born baby. You could not imagine him relating to his workers, inspiring confidence and motivation in a leadership role.
            However, as the show progresses through the seasons, you can see that his emotional intelligence starts to grow with the help of his peers who have a high level of emotional intelligence.

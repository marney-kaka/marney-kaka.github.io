    <h3>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
      <p>
        There's a well-known saying "you can't teach an old dog new tricks" that gives the impression that as you get older, your brain is incapable of learning new things. Obviously the originator of this saying hadn't heard of 'neuroplasticity'. 
        By understanding the principles of neuroplasticity (or the brains ability to re-wire and adapt), you can develop a 'growth mindset' and change your belief system in yourself - your own abilities, your attitude and behavioural responses to challenges or stimuli in your environment.
      </p>
        <br>
        <br>
    <h3>How I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit</h3>
      <p>
        If there is anything I have learned about neuroplasticity, it is that repitition is key.
        The more you perform a task, the stronger the connections in your brain become, making it easier for you to retain something. If we do it often enough, we start to do things automatically (auto pilot or muscle memory). Our Dev Academy facilitators say to us in homegroup not to worry about remembering all the functions and their syntax because we will do these often enough that we wont have to try and remember it. Of course, for those functions we do not use often, it goes without saying that google will be my best friend until those connections are strengthened.

    <h3>Ways to increase your neuroplasticity include:</h3>
      <p> 
          <Strong>Playing boardgames:</Strong> there are different types of boardgames that require different ways of thinking. Some involve:
      <ul>
        <li><strong> strategy</strong> (e.g. Monopoly)</li>
        <li><strong> luck</strong> (e.g. Ludo)</li>
        <li><strong> role playing</strong> (e.g. Dungeons and Dragons)</li>
        <li><strong> engine building</strong> (e.g. Furnace)</li>
      </ul>
          Try moving away from boardgames you know and are good at, and challenge yourself to master a boardgame of a different type. Each of the game types above stimulate the brain differently and push you to learn something new (e.g. compare your opponents' strategy to your own).
      </p>
      <p>
          <Strong>Reviewing learning material:</Strong>  seems a bit on the nose but our brains remember things better when the learning is fresh in our minds. After learning a small chunk of information, list three key points and then give your brain a rest for 5mins. When you come back, read your points before heading in to the next session to get your bearings and put information back in to context.
      </p>
      <p>
          <Strong>Exercise:</Strong> Im just saying. This is one way to increase your neuroplasticity through boosting neurogenesis (birth of new cells).
      </p>
      <p>
        <Strong>Practising mindfulness:</Strong> regularly practising mindfulness enables us to be kind to ours/others minds, body and soul and connecting us to the present moment. This not only improves our attention to the stimuli in our environment, but it also gives us an opportunity to identify our strengths and weaknesses, and develop our growth mindset.

    <h3>What is 'growth mindset'?</h3>
      <p> 
        'Fixed mindset' and 'growth mindset' are terms invented by Dr Carol Dweck to describe the underlying beliefs people have about learning   and intelligence. A fixed mindset is where individuals believe in their <u>basic</u> abilities, their intelligence, their talent; whereas someone with a growth mindset believes in their ability to get smarter, to keep learning, to put in more effort, and achieve higher success.

        <br> 
        In Carol Dwecks TED talk, she said "Praise wisely...dont praise intelligence and talent, that has failed. Dont do that anymore...praise the process...". Acknowledge and praise the process in which individuals reached success as this creates resiliance and hardiness. This resonated with me especially in my journey with Dev Academy. Its not about getting the green tick but appreciating the process, efforts, strategys, focus, perserverance and improvement. This helps to change mindsets and gives greater confidence to tackle larger problems.

        <strong>Integrating growth mindset into my learning journey: </strong>
        This is such a timely lesson for me. Its easy to come in to a new topic as a complete rookie and feel out of my depth. Practising mindfulness meditation each morning learned in sprint-3, and starting to develop a growth mindset after this exploration only reassures me that these feelings are valid and that all the highs and lows are important parts of my journey to help me grow and improve. My determination is now even higher.

        <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">HERE</a> is a link to a summary of Dr Dwecks research which I found particularly engaging.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        This exploration has helped me to understand that feelings of inadequacy are just symptoms of my brains neuroplasticity. Practising mindfulness before I start helps me to prepare my mind and body for what the day may bring emotionally, psychologically etc., and to take a step back, see the emotions and stimuli for what they are (symptoms), and to respond appropriately (e.g. take a break). I am considering practising mindfulness at the end of the day to wrap up as my mind and body really appreciates the pause from all the chaos it has had thrown at it.

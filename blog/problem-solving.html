      <h1>Problem Solving</h1><br>
      <h3>About a time when I was blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
        <p>
          I have been stuck so many times on simple problems like a missing capital letter or incorrect use of the semicolon/comma. I would be too occupied reading my code and checking the syntax that I'd overlook things like spelling mistakes.

      <h3>A time I elegantly solved a problem...</h3>
        <p>
          I cant wait for the day when I can say I <i>elegantly</i> solved a problem. In the gradebook kata I was feeling very confident in myself and solved a problem using a for loop and dot/bracket notations. It was among one of my most easy tasks I had completed and I felt so flash and a little proud that I was able to do it with little hassle. Of course I couldnt do it without my handy dandy google. This has been my go to for almost everything coding. I think this would be the closes I have to solving a problem elegantly, but watch this space.....

      <h3>How confident I feel using these problem-solving techniques/processes: </h3>
        <div class="grey-box">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h5>Pseudocode: 3/5</h5><br>
              This is a great way to organise my thoughts and remind me of the core problem. Its good to take notes of the thinking process so that if I need the function again, I can refer to them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>The Rubber Ducky method: 4/5</h5><br>
              I found this technique suited me really well. Hearing the problem out loud and working through it meant less clutter in my brain and I could focus on the problem line by line. I dont have a rubber ducky as such but my dog will do lol.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Reading error messages: 2/5</h5><br>
              I found this technique difficult as I am not 100 percent sure how to read the error messages yet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Console.logging: 2/5</h5><br>
              I started to get the hang of console.log this week which was cool. I havent mastered this yet, but getting there.
              I have been able to use it to check small chunks of my function before adding on another layer of variables which has been really helpful. I still need to get my head around incorporating its ability in to the body of a function.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Googling: 5/5</h5><br>
              Good ole google. My go to for the last 4 weeks. I am a VERY confident google user.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Asking peers for help: 4/5</h5><br>
              I am confident in asking my peers for help. I am yet to post in to the discord channel yet (that would be a 1 if it were rated).
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Asking coaches for help: 1/5</h5><br>
              I have only reached out once and they were so helpful. I just need to ask more often.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Improving your process with reflection: 3/5</h5><br>
              I feel like my process has improved with reflection. I found that I am a formative learner who assesses as I go instead of doing it all at the end in one bulk summary. This has changed my reflections entries which has saved me time. Additionally, I am able to review the last section as I am entering my reflections for the next section so I am reviewing my reflections often which is helpful too.

        <h1>Reflections</h1><br>
        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
          <ul class="li">
            <li> - I used to think that I was shy and introverted, but through core I learned it is my ego afraid of getting things wrong and being embarrassed.</li>
            <br>
            <li> - I am capable of more than I think I am. I have learned that with a growth mindset, I can push through. After the carnival exercises, I’ve seen for myself how much I have grown in the last 5 weeks.</li>
            <br>
            <li> - I can’t solve everything. Asking for help from others and getting their eyes on the problem is faster.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
        
        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p>
            Your values influence what you hold important to you and empathy is your ability to emotionally understand and relate to others around you. These are important in a space where everyone is learning a whole new language and have different levels of understanding and views.

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            I have surprised myself at how much I am enjoying the core learning now. It was the toughest part at the beginning and now I find it really rewarding. I have started embracing areas that need developing and acknowledging them for their contribution towards my learning journey as well. By doing reflections I am paying more attention to the ‘growing pains’ and with a growth mindset I welcome them as a symptom of change. 
          </p>

            <br>

          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            Writing a blog post for everyone to see would my biggest one. Privacy is a big thing for me so maintaining a public blog is quite challenging indeed. It has been good in a way and quite relieving to vent all my thoughts of struggles to a group of like-minded people. The other challenging aspect was examining my identity and exploring my values, ethics, strengths and limitations, especially the ethics question. It was a real struggle trying to think of an ethical situation.

          <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
          <p>
            From what I have seen of programming so far, everyone have different ways of solving a problem. Some can get to a solution quicker than others so having patience, empathy and being self-aware is important when programming together. I see posts in Discord where everyone is so encouraging and supportive and then I look at question-and-answer website for professional and enthusiastic programmers and see the importance of human skills. If DevAcademy produce more people with greater human skills than when they started, that would be an amazing industry to be part of.
